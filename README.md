# Assessment of Causal Association Between Type 2 Diabetes and Alzheimer's Disease with Mendelian Randomisation
This project demonstrates Two-Sample Mendelian Randomisation (2SMR) pipeline with TwoSampleMR R library. This project investigates causal effect of type 2 diabetes (T2D) on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) For exposure dataset, <a href="https://r4.finngen.fi/pheno/E4_DM2_STRICT">FinnGen data freeze 4 E4_DM2_STRICT</a> (type 1 diabetes as exclusion restriction and Type 2 diabetes with coma, ketoacidosis, renal complications, ophthalmic complications, neurological complications, peripheral circulatory complications, other complications, and without complications as inclusion restriction) GWAS summary-level statistics dataset, with 23 338 cases and 148 190 controls of Finnish ancestry was used. For outcome dataset, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0311-9">Jansen et al.</a> 24 087 European ancestry late-onset Alzheimer’s disease cases, 47,793 UK Biobank European ancestry individuals with family history of Alzheimer’s disease (AD-by-proxy), which is based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (rg = 0.81), and 383 378 European ancestry controls was used.
